I was honoured to be the 2015 Valedictorian for Mathematics convocation at the University of Waterloo.

Here's the script of my speech:

> Mr. Chancellor, members of convocation, fellow graduates, ladies, gentlemen, and beloved geese.
>
> My friends, we've made it to the top.
> To quote a prominent Canadian musician named Drake:
> ["We started from the bottom now we're here"](http://genius.com/Drake-started-from-the-bottom-lyrics).
>
> I think you'll all agree - getting through this school has been a pretty very transformative journey.
>
> Think back to five years ago, we were in high-school.
> Remember waiting for that email from OUAC?
> The acceptance letter saying "You're in!"?
>
> And in September, when we officially became part of the Waterloo family.
> We were riding high on stellar entrance averages,
> How did you feel?
> Did you feel invincible?
> Speaking for myself, I felt unstoppable: highschool left us at the top, and our lives were set, it should be easy to graduate from Waterloo.
> Or so I thought.
>
> Orientation week was our first brush of life at our new school.
> It was fun, which was a clever piece of deception.
> The week was filled with games and social events.
> For many, it was the first time that we'd encountered others with similar personalities and quirks.
> There was no stress, no deadlines.
> Just fun.
> For an example of the quirkyness, myself and a few others played a midnight game of sardines[^a] on  the 5th floor of MC[^1] until three in the morning.
> It was very quirky, but quirky in a way that's a unique quality of the Mathematics faculty at Waterloo.
>
> For myself, it felt like orientation week finished too soon.
> The week was truly a distraction before the meat grinder of courses began.
> Terms became an unrecognizable blur of rapid-fire assignments, midterms, co-op interviews, and finals all interspersed, and in quick succession.
> Even as I speak, it's easy to find students downing coffee, cramming for midterms, and waiting for interviews with big-name co-op employers, all at the same time.
> Myself, I developed a coffee addiction.
> With time, that turned into a coffee hobby[^coffee].
> The memories of early morning runs to the MC dropboxes after all-nighters have blended together.
> Honestly speaking, most of school blurs together like this, punctuated with a few key events.
> For example:
>
> - There were many new buildings built on campus, like
>   - Mathematics 3, the
>   - Quantum-Nano Centre
>   - and various Engineering Buildings.
> - There was the appointment of our Past-President David Johnston as the Governor General of Canada.
> - Venture Capitalists like Paul Graham and Sam Altman, and many other notable people have publicly recognized that the University of Waterloo is a leader in innovation.
>
> Iâ€™d like to think this indicates what survivors of our rigorous programs are able to accomplish when encountering real-life.
> As I speak, this work is becoming part of the past.
> And it'll soon be time to march onwards, once again.
>
> Earlier in the speech, I said _"my friends, we have made it to the top"_.
> You see, Highschool graduation looked and felt like the "top".
> Getting into Waterloo felt like the "top".
> Receiving an offer for the first co-op job felt like the "top".
> But when you look at these milestones together, by induction they're not the top.
> They're just inflection points.
> They're validation of where you are, not where you're going.
> They're chances to continue ascending, or to allow yourself to become average.
> The choice of which way you to go is yours, for yourself.
> You've started from the bottom, and now you're here.
>
> I'll restate my point;
> When you find yourself in a place where you're excited and proud about your accomplishments, you deserve to enjoy it.
> But it's also a good time to keep pushing and widen the lead.
>
> Maybe your friends and family will ask you about what you're doing next.
> Mine certainly have.
> _"What's next?"_
> _"How are you going to keep improving?"_
>
> Unfortunately, that's the wrong question.
> It's neither about us nor about how far we can go, but it's about what we do with what we've learned.
> It's about the difference we make in the communities we live in. It's about the impact on the people we touch.
> And it's about the relationships we form.
>
> You may not have the answers to these questions yet, but you do have the tools to make it happen.
> Who would have thought, five years ago, that we would have been sitting _here_ in this room together.
> Think of all of what we've accomplished: we're about to get our diplomas, we've developed friendships, and most importantly, we have momentum.
>
> Where this momentum takes you can be your choice.
> Make a conscious decision on which "top" is next, and work towards it.
> Think.
>
> Enjoy your day, take many photos, and beware of the geese.
> Congratulations once again.
>
> Thank you.
