Somehow, I was selected as the 2015 Valedictorian for Mathematics convocation at the University of Waterloo.

Here's a short transcript of my speech:

- Mr. Chancellor, members of convocation, fellow graduates, ladies, gentlemen, and beloved geese.
- I want to be the first to congratulate my fellow peers on our achievements.
  - But it sounds like it's happened, but I'm glad to congratulate you anyways.
  - Congratulations.
- My friends, we've made it to the top.
  - To quote a prominent Canadian musician named Drake:
    - ["We started from the bottom now we're here"](http://genius.com/Drake-started-from-the-bottom-lyrics).
- I think you'll all agree - getting through this school has been a pretty very transformative journey.
- Think back to five years ago.
  - You were in high-school.
  - Remember waiting for that acceptance letter? The email from OUAC saying "You're in!"?
  - Or in September, when we officially became part of the Waterloo family?
  - We were riding high on stellar entrance averages,
    - How did you feel?
      - Did you feel invincible?
  - Speaking for myself, I felt unstoppable
    - Highschool left us at the top.
    - Our lives were set, it should be easy to graduate from Waterloo.
  - Or so we thought.
- Orientation week was our first brush of life at our new school.
  - It was fun, which was a clever piece of deception.
  - The week was filled with games and social events.
  - For many, it was the first time that we'd encountered others with similar personalities and quirks.
  - There was no stress, no deadlines. Just fun.
    - For an example of the quirkyness, myself and a few others played a midnight game of sardines[^a] on  the 5th floor of MC[^1]
      until three in the morning.
      - It was very quirky, but quirky in a way that's a unique quality of the Mathematics faculty at Waterloo.
- For myself, it felt like orientation week finished too soon.
    - The week was truly a distraction before the meat grinder of courses began.
- Terms became an unrecognizable blur of rapid-fire assignments, midterms, co-op interviews, and finals all interspersed, and in quick succession.
    - Even as I speak, it's easy to find students downing coffee, cramming for midterms, and waiting for interviews with big-name co-op employers.
    - All at the same time.
  - Myself, I developed a coffee addiction. With time, that turned into a coffee hobby[^c].
  - The memories of early morning runs to the MC dropboxes after all-nighters have blended together.
  - Honestly speaking, most of school blurs together like this, punctuated with a few key events.
  - For example:
    - There were many new buildings built on campus, like
      - Mathematics 3, the
      - Quantum-Nano Centre
      - and various Engineering Buildings.
    - There was the appointment of our Past-President David Johnston as the Governor General of Canada.
    - Venture Capitalists like Paul Graham and Sam Altman, and many other notable people have publicly recognized that the University of Waterloo is a leader in innovation.
- I'd like to think this indicates what survivors of our rigorous programs are able to accomplish when encountering real-life.
- But as I speak, this work is becoming part of the past.
  - And it'll soon be time to march onwards, once again.
- Earlier in the speech, I said "my friends, we have made it to the top"
  - See:
    - Highschool graduation looked and felt like the "top"
    - Getting into Waterloo felt like the "top"
    - Receiving an offer for the first co-op job felt like the "top"
  - But when you look at these milestones together, by induction they're not the top.
    - They're just inflection points
      - Validation of where you are, and not where you're going
    - They're chances to continue ascending
      - or to allow yourself to become average
      - the choice is yours, for yourself
    - You've started from the bottom, and now you're here.
  - I'll restate my point;
    - When you find yourself in a place where you're excited and proud about your accomplishments
      - It's important to enjoy it,
    - But it's also a good time, to keep pushing.
    - And widen the lead.
- Maybe your friends and family will ask you about what you're doing next.
  - Mine certainly have.
  - "What's next?"
  - "How are you going to keep improving?"
- Unfortunately, that's the wrong question
  - It's not about us
    - or how high we can get
  - It's about what we do with what we've learned
    - It's about the difference we make in the communities we live in
    - It's about the impact on the people we touch
    - And it's about the relationships we form.
- You may not have the answers to these questions yet,
  - But you do have the tools to make it happen.
  - Who would have thought, five years ago, that we would have been sitting _here_ in
    - this room together.
  - Think of all of what we've accomplished:
    - We're about to get our diplomas
    - We've developed friendships
    - But most importantly, we have momentum.
- Where this momentum takes you can be your choice.
  - Make a conscious decision on which "top" is next, and work towards it.
  - Think.
- Enjoy your day,
  - Take many photos
  - Beware of the geese.
  - Congratulations once again,
  - Thank you.
