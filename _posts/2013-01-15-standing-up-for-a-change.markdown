Hello, you look familiar.

You remind me of somebody I think I was, rather than who I am today.
Maybe it's narcissism, but you have traits I think I've abandoned in search of a marginally better existence.
After all, you probably are an avid Chrome user, live in North America, aren't consuming my blog from your phone, and need to gulp down at least one cup of inexpensive coffee or hot chocolate every day to maintain a mental edge.
This uniformity allows economies of scale and vigorously discourages creativity.

[Maybe we're just mashups](http://blog.ted.com/2012/08/10/are-all-new-things-a-mash-up-of-what-came-before-a-qa-with-kirby-ferguson/) of ideas that resonate internally with us, or live in echo chambers that conform individual habits to the unexceptional standards shared by our surroundings.

We aren't standing up for a change but are merely contributors to difference.

It's like that people don't value affecting change or believe they are living on edge by possessing one trait that seemingly differentiates them from their peers.
Going to a different school than your childhood friends distinguishes you from others with equal opportunity to attend your pre-post-secondary institution then is insignificant once you arrive.

When people find themselves becoming the statistical mode instead of the modern-day Einstein they believe they are, society suggests they change what they're doing to re-gain their edge.
This brings me to my point.

When you do small things differently (use a standing desk, join different clubs, or eat different foods) you delude yourself that you've discovered a hidden key to success in a dimension of life that many can't see.
Perhaps you contribute to society - which is great - but there is no inherent change to you unless these changes are genuinely in your character, and not in your actions.
There's a defense involving a placebo, but I envisage that the high delivered by the placebo effect only lasts until the flaws presented by these new habits become apparent, and a new placebo emerges.

As a company trying to brand itself as a permanent fixture to modern life, how do you counteract this?

Gamification works as long as your users are enthused in the awards or believe in using your product more than you expect them to.
Since you're reading my post, I assume your users don't believe and thus churn at a sub-optimal rate.

To look at it from a different angle, *are the same customers that take the risks to use new products the same ones that will stick around for a while?*
