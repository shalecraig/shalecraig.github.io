My girlfriend has this tradition of writing New-Years resolutions. There is a merit to introspectively correcting your perceived shortcomings, but nothing is more humbling than writing them with someone else. As an added benefit, it keeps you honest.

One of my 2013 resolutions is to meet smart people.

I used to think I couldn't control the people I met; I now know otherwise. It's possible to go through life without choosing who you meet, it just sustains a plateau, or allows you to gracefully decline to the sub-par mellows of your surroundings.

My point is that if you only know the [People of Walmart](http://www.peopleofwalmart.com/), average is a sad look into the underbelly of America. If you surround yourself with the smartest people you know, average is much higher.

If you think perpendicular to the obvious path, you sometimes find an easier path to your end goal.
