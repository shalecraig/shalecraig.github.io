NASA didn't delay the Curiosity landing because they realized that the world doesn't live for Primetime.

```
Total cost of Curiosity:                           2.5 Billion USD [1]
Total cost to London for the 2012 Olympics:        14.5 Billion USD [2]
```

America's spending budget for the Curiosity rover is approximately one sixth of what London has spent on the entire Olympics.
