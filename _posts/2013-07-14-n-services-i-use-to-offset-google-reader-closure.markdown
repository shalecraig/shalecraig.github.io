title: "5 Services I Bound together to Replace Google Reader"

With much of the fanfare of Google Reader shutting down, I recently realized I inadvertently braced against it closing by relying on a bunch of services wrapped together using If This Then That ([IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/)).

Here's my setup:

* All my primary blog/article reading is done inside [Readability](https://www.readability.com/). They clean up the articles the way I like, and preserve a list of the articles I input. My favourite/the best articles are starred.

* I've set up IFTTT to move all of my starred articles into [Evernote](https://evernote.com/), since it scrapes the content and keeps it offline.

- Google Reader (I now use [Feedly](http://cloud.feedly.com/)) is the firehose of content. Through it, I subscribe to >50 blogs I like to read, some of which I'd forget to check (from [Dustin Curtis](http://dcurt.is) to [a friend's food blog](http://onehungryguy.tumblr.com/)). When reading, I scan through these and star the articles that look interesting. IFTTT takes the starred articles, and adds them to Readability.

I've accrued some other services over the years: [Buffer](http://bufferapp.com/) shares things, since I rather share things over time, and I have some custom services setup to create RSS feeds.

By splitting my pipeline into different segments, I very easily overcome the adverse affects of shutdowns/failed startups.

I've been using this setup for ~5 years (or however long that IFTTT has been around). It's been great.
