I was trying to get Scala setup with Intellij, and noticed that it was asking me
about the Scala home directory.

For Scala installed using homebrew's `brew install scala` command, homebrew
outputs a nice message when `brew info scala` is run:

```
$ brew info scala
....

==> Caveats
To use with IntelliJ, set the Scala home to:
  /usr/local/opt/scala/idea
```

I was surprised.



I promise to write more soon, but maybe this may help some others. Recently I've
been working on [Accel](http://github.com/shalecraig/accel), which is nearing a
release I'm proud of. Look for a post on it then.
