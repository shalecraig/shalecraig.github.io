From time to time, I decide to learn about/play around with a new language.

I've slowly constructed a series of exercises that I understand well and feel confident implementing in languages I regularly use.
This list is designed to take knowledge from `hello world` to marginal comfort.

This is by no means comprehensive, and I'm just leaving this as a way for me to update whenever necessary.

### Programs: ###

- Hello World - the program that starts it all. More often than not, this is really a test if I can get my environment setup.

- 'Hello Shale' test - this teaches about user input.

- 'Guess the number' game - this teaches variables, control flow, and the use of external libraries to generate random numbers.

- 'Median of Medians' algorithm - this teaches about recursion, lists, arrays, and some basic math. By taking dynamic input, we deal with strings and dynamic allocation.

- 'Levenshtein Distance API' - this teaches string indexing and API design.

- 'Genetic Algorithm' - from a random initial generation of strings, create successive generations until the string 'hello world' is generated.

- 'Union Find' - implement the fast [union find](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure#Disjoint-set_forests) data structure.

<!-- - 'Levenshtein Trie' - implement [this description](http://blog.vjeux.com/2011/c/c-fuzzy-search-with-trie.html) -->

Between the first and last 'hello world', this is a great introduction to a language.

Let me know if you have any suggestions for other things frequently used.
I know I don't deal with memory allocation/OOP, but there are others I've missed too.
