I've been coming up with a bunch of hard questions that I don't know the answer to.
Not all of them will have precise answers.

Consider this a WIP.

## Questions

1. It's generally acknowledged that technology removes jobs.
What do we see in our economy as the effect of this?
In other words, is the devaluation of undergrad degrees a symptom of this phenomenon?

1. How does one develop knowledge?
i.e. in a constrained environment, how do people develop knowledge out of nothingness?
People can [develop skills through practice](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/1n1rbu/is_it_possible_to_practice_in_one_area_so_that/), and knowledge through experience, I suppose.

1. What is the best way to teach people to think?
That is, as technology reduces the need for non-thinking jobs, we need to educate the people that would've filled that role.
How can we do that effectively?

1. Is teaching quality improving?
Can we measure teaching quality accurately?
Can countries set themselves up to capitalize by improving the teaching quality for the next five years?
The payout will not be for at least a decade, but you can't lose with an educated populous.

1. How do communist 5-year plans work?
It seems to [work well for communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Five-Year_Plan_\(Soviet_Union), what's preventing democracy from implementing these plans?
Is this emblematic of the shortcomings of democracy, or an abject failure of all incarnations of it?

1. What quantifiable benefit do I receive from consuming (reading, watching, etc) the sources I do right now?
As in, can I quantify and justify everything I spend my time on?
When should I stop consuming these, and when should I spend more time?

1. Will a bottom fall out of the software industry, or will pairing it with hardware prevent it from happening?
Too many big things rely mainly on ads for income; what happens when fewer companies buy ads?
Hardware is limited by physical distribution, but the software market is getting crowded.
Are we at at the tipping point between hardware and software?

1. Applications that are Startups are cogs in the wheel of the owners of app stores.
Do people who write apps realize that?
If so, how do they justify creating job security while their application is subject to the whims of the app store gods?

1. Would forcing all adults to take (and pass) a new *useful* course every year be advantageous to society?
We could teach people how to do stuff, but this would be a waste of time if taken lightly.

1. What is the most likely way to become an exceptional person?
No individual has a template to do this - the sheer volume of mediocre self-help books is evidence to that.
Can you learn to be exceptional by talking to exceptional and non-exceptional people?
Successful goal-oriented people may become exceptional.
