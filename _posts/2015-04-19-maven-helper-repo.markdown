I created a [new Github Repo](https://github.com/shalecraig/maven-helper-scripts), titled "maven helper scripts."

The impetus is that maven's a pretty unwieldy tool to use from the command-line, and every so often I want to create a new project.
Almost every time that I create a new project, I need to look up the commands, which is silly.
