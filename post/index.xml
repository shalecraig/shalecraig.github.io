      <description>I really liked Henrik&amp;rsquo;s blog post about on-call. Many of the points ring true with my experience over the years.
I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt something about scheduling on-call shifts over the past 18 months which leads to meaningful improvements work-life balance, and wanted to pass the idea on.
Long rotations are filled with compromises:
Compared to smaller time slices, trading a week is inherently harder. Because it&amp;rsquo;s larger amount of time, others are more likely to have conflicts with the week you’re trying to get out of.</description>

      <description>I was honoured to be the 2015 Valedictorian for Mathematics convocation at the University of Waterloo.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the script of my speech:
 Mr. Chancellor, members of convocation, fellow graduates, ladies, gentlemen, and beloved geese.
My friends, we&amp;rsquo;ve made it to the top. To quote a prominent Canadian musician named Drake: &amp;ldquo;We started from the bottom now we&amp;rsquo;re here&amp;rdquo;.
I think you&amp;rsquo;ll all agree - getting through this school has been a pretty very transformative journey.</description>

      <title>Maven Github Repo</title>
      <link>http://shalecraig.github.io/post/2015-04-19-maven-helper-repo/</link>

      <guid>http://shalecraig.github.io/post/2015-04-19-maven-helper-repo/</guid>
      <description>I created a new Github Repo, titled &amp;ldquo;maven helper scripts.&amp;rdquo;
The impetus is that maven&amp;rsquo;s a pretty unwieldy tool to use from the command-line, and every so often I want to create a new project. Almost every time that I create a new project, I need to look up the commands, which is silly.</description>

      <title>Scala config for IntelliJ</title>
      <link>http://shalecraig.github.io/post/2014-04-06-scala-config-for-intellij/</link>

      <guid>http://shalecraig.github.io/post/2014-04-06-scala-config-for-intellij/</guid>
      <description>I was trying to get Scala setup with Intellij, and noticed that it was asking me about the Scala home directory.
For Scala installed using homebrew&amp;rsquo;s brew install scala command, homebrew outputs a nice message when brew info scala is run:
$ brew info scala .... ==&amp;gt; Caveats To use with IntelliJ, set the Scala home to: /usr/local/opt/scala/idea  I was surprised, and figured I&amp;rsquo;d post it.</description>

      <description>From time to time, I like to play around with a new programming languages.
I&amp;rsquo;ve designed a few generic exercises for experienced programmers to give them a feel on how these languages work.
You&amp;rsquo;ll walk away having implemented a Genetic Algorithm in this language - all in the span of about four hours.
Exercises:  &amp;lsquo;Hello World&amp;rsquo; - the archetypal program that starts it all. Since code examples can typically be found online, this is just to ensure the environment is setup correctly.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been coming up with a bunch of hard questions that I don&amp;rsquo;t know the answer to. Not all of them will have precise answers.
Consider this a WIP.
Questions  It&amp;rsquo;s generally acknowledged that technology removes jobs. What do we see in our economy as the effect of this? In other words, is the devaluation of undergrad degrees a symptom of this phenomenon?
 How does one develop knowledge?</description>

      <description>I bought a Raspberry Pi the other day to set it up as a Wifi Access Point. I had a bit of trouble setting up, so I decided to document what I was doing in case I need to do it again.
Feel free to let me know about any issues/etc in the comments, or on twitter.
Consider this a WIP.

      <description>With much of the fanfare of Google Reader shutting down, I recently realized I inadvertently braced against it closing by relying on a bunch of services wrapped together using If This Then That (IFTTT).
Here&amp;rsquo;s my setup:
 All my primary blog/article reading is done inside Readability. They clean up the articles the way I like, and preserve a list of the articles I input. My favourite/the best articles are starred.</description>

      <description>NASA didn&amp;rsquo;t delay the Curiosity landing because they realized that the world doesn&amp;rsquo;t live for Primetime.
Total cost of Curiosity: 2.5 Billion USD [1] Total cost to London for the 2012 Olympics: 14.5 Billion USD [2]  America&amp;rsquo;s spending budget for the Curiosity rover is approximately one sixth of what London has spent on the entire Olympics.
